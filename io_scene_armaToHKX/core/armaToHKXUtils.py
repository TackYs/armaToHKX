#Broken out parts and some hacks of blender_niftools_plugin to export skeletons to .hkx as well as
#Exporting animations using kfmaker instead of the blender_niftools_plugin
#MUST HAVE blender_niftools_plugin installed in blender for this script to work.
#Built using v0.0.9, might not work with future versions or pyffi updates
